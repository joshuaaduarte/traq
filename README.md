# traq
A web application that tackles the problem of being able to store all the information that is pertinent to ones life in one single space. From quotes, names and birthdays, book log, to lessons learned,  Traq aims to be a user friendly space where any type of information can be stored and tracked.


## Login 

The user will be using a firebase credential login to be able to access the database itself. This should be able to use ones email and password, or other sites like that of google and microsoft. 


## Main Page
The main page will be comprised of ways to insert information in a easy manner. The four main sections that I want to start off with are quotes, lessons learned, contacts, and journal entries. Having these areas that are associated with a general icon of sorts will create a seamless user interface. 

## Quotes
This section will have entry points for information pertaining to the quote. Whether it be from a book (book author), movie, or just a person, there will be areas where users will be able to input information for it. 

## Lessons Learned
This area should allow a user to input a lesson learned that they have. These could be associated to work, projects, personal life, etc. Should have areas to distinguish what type of lesson learned it is.


## Contacts
This section is rather important as it will hold vital information that would more than likely be beneficial to the user. It should hold contact information for anyone they like. Here it will contain the name, association, methods to contact, and notes that may be useful to the user. 

## Journal Entries
Here, the user will be able to enter daily, weekly, monthly, or any time framed journal entries which can be looked upon in the future. There should be a way to input a rating of sorts for how they feel about their current situation and so forth. 

## Profile
Here, there will be a place for a users own personal information like that of their name, birthday, and account information.
